# CJ_AiAgent: A Humorous Crypto Twitter Bot Powered by AI

Welcome to **CJ_AiAgent**, a Twitter bot that generates hilarious cryptocurrency-related tweets with the street-smart humor of Carl "CJ" Johnson from **GTA San Andreas**. Not only does the bot post funny tweets, but it also interacts with the crypto community by commenting on tweets from selected accounts, throwing support or playful "hate" in true CJ fashion.

## üöÄ Features

- **Automated Tweets**: The bot posts cryptocurrency-related tweets automatically every 30 minutes.
- **Humorous Style**: Tweets are generated in the irreverent, street-smart tone of Carl "CJ" Johnson, adding humor to the crypto space.
- **Support & Hate Comments**: The bot can interact with selected crypto accounts by leaving either supportive or "hate" comments on their latest tweets.

## üé• Demo

Here's an example of a tweet the bot could generate:

> "Man, cryptos are like Big Smoke's appetite - they just keep gettin' bigger, and you never know when they gonna crash! Big Smoke would've loved this shit, spendin' all his crypto on Cluckin' Bell meals, sayin', 'All you had to do was follow the damn chart, CJ!' üöÄ #crypto"

The bot can also interact with Twitter accounts from the crypto community, leaving comments like:

> "Yo, @Bitcoin, you're crushing it in the crypto game! üöÄ Keep it up, homie! #CryptoKing"

Or some playful "hate":

> "Man, @Crypto_Messiah, your crypto game is weaker than Big Smoke's appetite. üòÇ Time to step it up! #WeakHustle"

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Automated Tweets**: Every 30 minutes, the bot generates and posts a new tweet about the crypto market using OpenAI's GPT model.
2. **Interaction with Crypto Accounts**: The bot checks the latest tweets from specific accounts in the crypto community and comments with either support or playful hate.
3. **Generated Comments**: The comments are dynamically created based on the account being interacted with, and they are either supportive or mocking in true CJ style.
